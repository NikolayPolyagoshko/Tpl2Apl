# Tpl2Apl
PS Script which converts Tecan's Tpl files into Apl format.

This Windows Powershell script was designed to be run by windows scheduler.
It reads Tpl-files from one or many source paths, converts Tpl-files into Apl format, and writes Apl-files into one or many destination paths. The main reason for creating this script was that Tecan's Freedom EVOlution software does not have an option to save plate layout  in Apl format which can be easyly used as layout source for Tecan's Magellan.
